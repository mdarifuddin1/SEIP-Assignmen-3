                            <p>Last October 13th IIT Bombay TECH FEST Bangladesh Zonal Round, our team was selected as the top team in the selection round among the top 35 university teams in Bangladesh. Alhamdulillah next December 16th we are going to IIT Bombay (Mumbai), India to participate in South Asia's biggest Tech-fest final round, to represent Bangladesh and our Prime Asia University. This is our first international robotics event. Everyone's prayers and love can carry us forward.</p>

                            <p >Asia's largest technological Techfest challenge organized by India's IIT Bombay, saw the participation of teams from 40+ Asian and non-Asian countries including Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Brazil. The Prime Asia University team representing Bangladesh in the robotics competition, Termite, placed among the top ten in the Cozmo Cleanse segment. This achievement is undoubtedly a great honor for Prime Asia University as well as the country.</p>

                            <p>If you listen to the discussion about quantum computing, you will think that it is science fiction. But we have reached the pinnacle of computer technology which defies logic and defeats the imagination. The transistors used in todayâ€™s computers are so small that they can be made with the technology at hand. So computer inventors have begun to look for possible solutions at the nuclear and ultra-atomic levels, known as quantum computing.</p>
